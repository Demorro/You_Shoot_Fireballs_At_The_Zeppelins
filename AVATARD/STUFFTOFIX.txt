Stuff to fix

When standing on zeppelin, make it go back to center rather than follow you or the whole pack will just wander off the map
shooting a zeppelin while standing on it makes you rotate and be destroyed with it
	SO : Make sure your rotation is set so you are standing up every frame(or so)
	   : Make sure when you destroy a zeppelin you are on, you are unparented from it
You can hit the colliders with your head or from below, 2 possible solutions
	SO : Make the zeppelin platforms only collide on one side(the top,) not entirely sure if this is possible or if it will work
	   : Do a complicated set up of player foot collider and zeppelin platform, making it so that only the foot collider triggers parenting, and that when it collides you are set to exactly 
		 the top of the zeppelin platform
